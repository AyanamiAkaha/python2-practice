# DISCLAIMER

I *do not* like python. I *do not* plan on using it in any production
code. Sad thing is the python is so widely used I cannot just ignore its
existance, thus this repository. It's just for random code samples I
wrote during learning it.

Feel free to use it however you like, but bear in mind the code samples
are definitely not production0-ready, and probably not even good as
examples.
